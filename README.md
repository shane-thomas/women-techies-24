# HerWay in React Native and Expo

This app was built as part of a hackathon. This is a travel blogging app exclusively for women to navigate through new unknown locations in a safe and secure way; built using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) & [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/expo-cli/).

HerWay is a mobile app built in 48 hours at a hackathon, empowering women to rate and review the safety of locations in real time. Using Firebase for backend storage and React Native with Expo for cross-platform development, HerWay visualizes community safety with intuitive heatmaps on both iOS and Android.
