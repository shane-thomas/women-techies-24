# HerWay in React Native and Expo

This app was built as part of a hackathon. This is a travel blogging app exclusively for women to navigate through new unknown locations in a safe and secure way; built using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) & [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/expo-cli/).
